Aaron:
Make a profile page, things such as profile picture, and features that help user experience such as large icons and buttons and navigation between many different tabs and sections.

Akshay:
Work on many tabs and the addition feature of the portfolio, each one should be able to save and display on the portfolio.

Parth:
Manage overarching class design, create the share tab and associated things, add a save as PDF feature, make it easy for users to connect with other people over LinkedIn,



Development of App Phase:
Allow users to make an account to separate themselves from others on the database.

Interesting things to think about:
How to update important events (will we manually update or will we web scrape from HHS website) or use an embed link to avoid bot control














Design structure
Logo necessary
Simple, pastel colors
Edit button
Bottom of each page, allows person to change to edit mode so that they can change the contents of every page
Navigation page:
Elements included in navigation pane/window:
Home/View page (should look nice)
Accounts page(edit account information)
Settings (font size, color, ect.)
Editing your portfolio
Viewing other portfolios
Photo/status at the top
Dropdowns for each individual category of achievement
In each dropdown are listed achievements
Achievements can have links attached that lead to external locations (google, hyperlink) 
Three bars or some other logo to click on which overlaps the page but does not disconnect from it so that a person can look at the navigation panel without losing their spot on the website that they were at before clicking on the navigation pane
Many tabs for each thing
View tab to see full portfolio 
Could share with social media
Home page 
Constitutes of the main viewing portfolio page, from where if someone has access to edit the portfolio then they are allowed to change into edit mode
Has an area where you can explore other peopleâ€™s portfolios (leads to a separate tab)
Maybe we can regulate this by asking people for their school and showing people based on their filters (grade, school, district, sports, etc.)
